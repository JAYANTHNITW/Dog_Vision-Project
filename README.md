# Dog_Vision-Project
### Objective: Is to classify different breeds of dogs.
### Solution: I used Deep learning pretrained model named: Mobilenetv2. I think this is the best visulizing project i ever done. On training of 3k images from the entire dataset of 10k images got an accuracy of 80%. 
I have used the following functions:
1. os.listdir-->It can access all the files in a folder in a string format.
2. to_numpy()--> Dataframe column to a list of numpy array()
3. next i turned every label into boolean array
4. numpy argmax-->used to find the index of max value in an array
